Include all relevant attachments in your export.

== Description ==

When selecting one post type in the WordPress export screen, by default the linked media (attachments) are not included.

This plugin adds an "Export media with selected content" option. When checked, the plugin tries to find featured images and included media in the post_content, adding them to the export file.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/export-media-with-content` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Images seem to be missing in the export file =
This plugin hooks into the WordPress export routine and *tries* to find images related to the post (page, etc.). It does so by looking for "attached" (uploaded to) media and it searches the body of the post (the post_content) for image files.

It's possible that themes or plugins use different ways of referencing media to your post. This plugin will not find those.

= The images are imported into the new site but eg. my galleries are broken =
In eg. the Gutenberg gallery block, when you select an image size (for the gallery) the images with that size are 'hard-coded' in the html.

The WordPress import routine downloads the original image of the 'export site' and re-creates the configured image sizes. When your configured image sizes differ, you might end up with broken galleries.

So make sure both sites have the same image sizes configured. See the Media settings in both sites and check if themes or plugins use `add_image_size()` [reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_image_size/).

= Can I (have somebody) extend this plugin? =
Yes! The plugin features two filter hooks:
* `export_query`
* `export_query_media_ids`

Please browse the code to see what they do, I guess `export_query_media_ids` is easiest to use as it requires you to just add more attachment IDs to an array.

== Screenshots ==
1. "Export media with selected content" checkbox option now available in the Export screen.
