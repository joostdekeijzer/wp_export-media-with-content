== Description ==

When selecting one post type in the WordPress export screen, by default the linked media (attachments) are not included.

This plugin adds an "Export media with selected content" option. When checked, the plugin tries to find featured images and included media in the post_content, adding them to the export file.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/export-media-with-content` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
